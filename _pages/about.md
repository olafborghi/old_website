I am a early career researcher and PhD student in the project [“Interdisciplinary Perspectives of the Politics of Adolescence & Democracy”](https://www.ippad.eu/) at Royal Holloway, University of London. In this project I will investigate the relative contributions of cognitive and emotional traits to ideological thinking across the developmental window of adolescence.

I completed a MSc in Psychology with a specialization in social neuroscience, cognitive psychology and research methods at the University of Vienna. In my master thesis, I investigated factors that modulate neural activation during action observation. I also worked as a research assistant in the [Social, Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience (SCAN) Unit](https://scan-psy.univie.ac.at/), where I contributed to projects on comparative neuroscience with dogs and humans, and in the Methods Department, where I contributed to statistics lectures and mindfulness research.
